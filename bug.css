The CSS property `calc()` can produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit consistency.  For example:

```css
.element { width: calc(100% - 50px); }
```

This is usually fine. However, try this:

```css
.element { width: calc(50% + 50px - 10%); }
```

The order of operations might not be what you expect, leading to incorrect width calculations.  Another issue is mixing units inconsistently: `calc(100px + 50%)` is also prone to errors unless the browser can successfully infer the correct unit.
